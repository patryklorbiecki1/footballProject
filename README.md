# Simple football API
### Project Description:
This project is focused on football-related data processing and analysis. It involves working with football events, specifically matches from the UEFA Champions League. The main objective is to retrieve and analyze data related to these events, such as teams (competitors), venues, and probabilities of different match outcomes.

### Key Features:

Data Extraction: 
The project utilizes libraries like Jackson to read JSON data and extract relevant information from football event files.

Competitor Analysis: The code includes functionalities to retrieve and process information about competitors (teams) participating in the events.
Venue Information: The project also involves capturing and handling venue details, including the venue's name, capacity, location, and other relevant attributes.

Probability Calculation: The code calculates probabilities for different match outcomes, such as the home team winning, a draw, or the away team winning.

Sorting and Filtering: The project provides capabilities to sort and filter competitors based on specific criteria, such as their names or other attributes.

Stream Processing: The code leverages Java streams to perform operations on the extracted data, enabling efficient and concise data processing.
Overall, this project aims to provide a framework for working with football event data, extracting relevant information, and conducting various analyses. It offers functionalities for competitor analysis, venue information retrieval, probability calculation, and efficient data processing using Java streams.
